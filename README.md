# Transparent Supply Chain Tracking System

## Overview
This smart contract, written in Clarity, is designed to enhance transparency and traceability in supply chains. It enables manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and consumers to track product movement and certifications in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- **Entity Registration:** Manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and certifiers can register with specific roles.
- **Product Tracking:** Products move through different states (Manufactured, In Transit, At Retailer, Sold, Recalled, etc.).
- **Certifications:** Certifiers can issue certifications to products based on sustainability and ethical standards.
- **Audit Trail:** Products maintain a history of ownership and movement.

## Smart Contract Functions
### 1. Entity Management
- `register-entity` - Registers a new entity with a type (manufacturer, supplier, retailer, certifier, consumer).
- `get-entity` - Retrieves details of a registered entity.

### 2. Product Lifecycle
- `register-product` - Registers a new product under a manufacturer.
- `transfer-product` - Transfers product ownership between entities.
- `update-product-state` - Updates the state of a product in the supply chain.
- `get-product` - Retrieves product details and its history.

### 3. Certification
- `issue-certification` - Certifiers can assign sustainability certifications to products.
- `get-certification` - Fetches details of a product's certification.

## How to Deploy
1. Ensure you have a Clarity-enabled blockchain environment (Stacks Blockchain).
2. Deploy the contract using the Clarity CLI or Stacks Explorer.
3. Interact with the contract via Clarity functions in a frontend or API service.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for better security.
- Introduce immutable storage for certifications using IPFS.
- Develop a user-friendly UI for real-time tracking.
